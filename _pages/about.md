Hello, I'm Kibum Kim!  

Currently, I'm a Master's degree candidate for [Industrial & Systems Engineering](https://statistics.kaist.ac.kr/) at [KAIST](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/kr/), where i am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Chanyoung Park](https://dsail.kaist.ac.kr/professor/).

I'm actively on research with my best teammates at [DSAIL@KAIST](https://dsail.kaist.ac.kr/).

I'm interested in addressing the issue of long-tailedness in various domain such as **Graph Neural Networks**, **Recommendation**, and **Scene Understanding**.


* **Graph Neural Networks**: Class & Degree long-tailedness  
* **Recommendation**: User & Item long-tailedness  
* **Scene Understanding**: Predicate long-tailedness
