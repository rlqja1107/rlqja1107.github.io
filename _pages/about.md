Hello, I'm Kibum Kim!  

Currently, I'm a Ph.D student in [Industrial & Systems Engineering](https://statistics.kaist.ac.kr/) at [KAIST](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/kr/), where i am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Chanyoung Park](https://dsail.kaist.ac.kr/professor/).

I'm actively on research with my best teammates at [DSAIL@KAIST](https://dsail.kaist.ac.kr/).

I'm interested in addressing the issue of `long-tailedness` in various domain such as **Scene Understanding**, **Recommendation**, and **Graph Neural Networks**.  
 
* **Scene Understanding**: Predicate long-tailedness  
* **Recommendation**: User & Item long-tailedness  
* **Graph Neural Networks**: Class & Degree long-tailedness  

`Large Language Models` (LLMs) shows the exceptional generalizability in NLP. I'm currently interested in leveraging them to address the long-tailed problems.

Feel free to contact me through *kb.kim@kaist.ac.kr* email.
