Hello, I'm Kibum Kim!  

Currently, I'm a Ph.D student in [Industrial & Systems Engineering](https://statistics.kaist.ac.kr/) at [KAIST](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/kr/), where i am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Chanyoung Park](https://dsail.kaist.ac.kr/professor/).

I'm actively on research with my best teammates at [DSAIL@KAIST](https://dsail.kaist.ac.kr/).

Nowadays, machine learning has advanced significantly and is being applied across various domains. However, despite these advancements, fundamental challenges still arise. In this regard, I focus on addressing the challenges of machine learning that occur across diverse domains. The challenges that i have been addressed are as follows:
 
* **Long-tailedness**: The challenge of predicting tail classes 
* **Data Scarcity**: The challenge of collecting large-scale datasets
* **Adversarial Attacks**: The challenge of preserving model's robustness under attacks 

Specifically, the domains addressing these challenges include `Scene Understanding`, `Recommender Systems`, and `Graph Neural Networks`.


I will keep striving to tackle the fundamental challenges that occur in machine learning across various domains.
