Hello, I'm Kibum Kim!  

Currently, I'm a third-year Ph.D student in [Industrial & Systems Engineering](https://statistics.kaist.ac.kr/) at [KAIST](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/kr/), where i am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Chanyoung Park](https://dsail.kaist.ac.kr/professor/). I'm holding a position of visiting scholar at [University of California SanDiego (UCSD)](https://ucsd.edu/), mentored by [Prof. Julian McAuley](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/).

During my visit, I am focusing on Video Large Language Models to address their limitations in visual grounding capability. Previously, my research interests lay in scene understanding in the image and video domains, where I worked on challenges such as long-tailed distributions, data scarcity, and recommender systems.

If you are interested or have any question, please don't hesitate to reach out to me at *kb.kim@kaist.ac.kr* email.
